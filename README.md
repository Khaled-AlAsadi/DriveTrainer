## Future Development

#### Update Styles of the page

The styles was not a huge focus because the app is a static webpage. In the future i should focus on updating the styles.

#### Ability to search through the content

This feature allows the user to filter through the content by making a search.

#### Hosting Pictures

The feature is intended to host pictures instead of using pictures from a different page. Right now the app uses picture from another site which is not optimal
